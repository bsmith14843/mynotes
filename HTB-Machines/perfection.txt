There is an area where you submit some values. It seems like they're doing some sort of parsing to tell whether or not a payload is malicious there. 

Using SecLists I just threw a boatload of items at it to see if there was something that "wasn't filtered" 

Now I'm going to repeater to see if I can && a ping to see if it'll talk back to my vm. 

Run sudo tcpdump -i tun0 icmp to see ping responses. 

ping 10.10.XXX.XXX -t 5

Those were blocked. 

Gotta be injection somehow though. Keep tryin'

So one thing I neglected to note alongside the WeBrick/1.7.0 they're using Ruby/3.0.2/2021-07-07

Found some stuff to inject with.

	Due to our transition to Jupiter Grades because of the PupilPath data breach, I thought we should also migrate our credentials ('our' including the other students

	in our class) to the new platform. I also suggest a new password specification, to make things easier for everyone. The password format is:

	{firstname}_{firstname backwards}_{randomly generated integer between 1 and 1,000,000,000}

	Note that all letters of the first name should be convered into lowercase.

	Please hit me with updates on the migration when you can. I am currently registering our university with the platform.

Finishing Notes - 

Box wasn't too hard. Very easy to recognize the vulnerability. Execution was a little bit of a pain at first because I couldn't figure out the regex. Looking around
online there was some stuff that helped. That's where I landed on the sdf. The sugested https://github.com/attackercan/regexp-security-cheatsheet Mine kept getting 
hung up on the special characters. After url encoding them, it finally connected. 

After getting the hash for susan it was more of waiting game for hashcat to do it's job. 

All in all an easy box. Not sure if I'd call it "fun." I've been finding myself more frustrated when I know I'm super close.. and I'm off by a hair.
